git clone https://github.com/rshrc/testing

After you have made changes to the repo
git add -A
git commit -m "Commit Message goes here"
git push origin master


# Django Commands, you will not need the first 2 commands
# because you will be cloning the repository
django-admin startproject testing
cd testing && python3 manage.py startapp predict

making changes in the INSTALLED_APPS = ['predict',] <- dont forget the comman

# You dont need to do the above if you are cloning the repo

# from this you need

python3 manage.py makemigrations predict
python3 manage.py migrate
python3 manage.py runserver
